# Daily Scrum

We held a daily scrum standup meeting every weekday during University in the morning, timeboxed to 15 minutes. We discussed what we did the day before, what we plan on doing on the day and any issues or road blocks we may have encountered. On the weekend, where it was not possible for all our scrum team members to meet in person, we held a group video call using Discord, still applying the 15 minutes timebox.

We have recorded a couple of minutes as a sample of what we talk about during the meetings. [OneDrive](https://uniofleicester-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hd180_student_le_ac_uk/EiijBelliuZFkk_bU1kkyPsBAKZC1njHYSYY6nvxZAwnrw?e=vgeyOY)
