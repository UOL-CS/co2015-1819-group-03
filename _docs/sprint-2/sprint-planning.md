# Sprint Planning
We held a sprint planning meeting at university with all the team members; product owner, scrum master and scrum team members. Our meeting was time boxed to two hours since the team learn to do the planning effectively in a short period of time. During our sprint planning meeting, we discussed and reviewed each item in the product backlog. Having inspected the items, we realised that the user stories could be broken down into smaller ones to help us be more precise on each individual feature. Consequently, we changed the story points as well. We estimated them by using planning poker technique. The advantage of using the planning poker technique is to provide an opportunity for all team membersâ€™ equal contribution in estimating the story points.

Near the end of the spring planning meeting, we revisited our definition of done for this project to make sure each team member is clear on what classifies as a "done" user story.

## Sprint goal
Our sprint goal is to complete the exercise list page and the exercise page to provide a medium for the students to see all the available exercises and to be able to browse through all of them individually.
