# Sprint Planning

We held our sprint planning meeting for sprint 3 at university where all the team members were present. The meeting was timeboxed to 2 hours as we agreed this is plenty of time to go over what and how we will aim for the stories to be completed. We considered how we will work together as a team to achieve the stories. 

We started off with the product owner showing and explaining our product backlog and what order our stories will be completed and we then discussed how we will approach these stories and what stories will provide a real challenge for our team. Our supervisor suggested some changes to the product backlog which we have stuck with as we also agreed with the new order. 

## Sprint goal

Our sprint goal for sprint 3 is to complete pulling of an exercise using the terminal and thoroughly testing this feature, before delivering.
