# Sprint Restrospective

Although this sprint we only completed one story it was something we were never taught before and provided a real challenge for our scrum team. This sprint was surely our most technically challenging as the obstacles we had to overcome were steep and a lot research had to be completed in order to make our application architecture to work. We modified our architecture after receiving advice from our supervisor which meant our sprint goal had to be slightly changed. In addition,we learnt that when estimating user stories, we should consider other factors such as how confident we are using the technologies in the story. For future user story estimation, we hope that our experience will guide us to make more accurate estimates.
