# Sprint Planning

At university we held our sprint planning meeting which was timeboxed to 2 hours where Product Owner, Scrum master and the rest of Scrum team were present. This meeting began with the Product Owner briefing the rest of the scrum team the current stories in the product backlog and what stories will be aimed to be achieved by the end of sprint. In addition, we also discussed our estimates for our stories, using the poker planning technique, and ensuring we think of the technical challenges of our stories. We discussed this as we really underestimated the level of difficulty in terms of the technical aspects of the story completed in the previous sprint. 

## Spring Goal 

The sprint goal we have set for this sprint is to complete the key aspect of the system, that being marking the solution to an exercise, resulting in a mark and feedback that will be shown to the user.
