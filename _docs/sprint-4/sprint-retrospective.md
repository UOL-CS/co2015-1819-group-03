# Sprint Restrospective

The sprint retrospective was timeboxed to 45 minutes and all the members of the scrum team were present. In this sprint the real focus was on the core functionality of our application that being the submission, marking and feedback of the exercises completed by users.  Completing these stories was a real challenge for the scrum team as we had to find a way to submit the solution of an exercise as an attempt to be marked by the system and eventually provide user with the proper feedback. After many obstacles, we overcame our challenges and completed 3 user stories (and many bug fixes) in this sprint and now our application has its main functionality implemented. During the time of the sprint, we learned that our user story estimations still were not as accurate as we had anticipated. We believe that this will improve as we grow and get more experience. We also learnt that we should ask the client more valuable and precise questions that will allow us to visualise what the client wants.
