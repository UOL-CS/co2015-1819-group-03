# Sprint Review

Before our sprint review, we had fixed 2 bugs and completed a total of 3 stories which were presented during the meeting that was timeboxed to 30 minutes. Throughout the meeting, the client viewed the product and after this gave suggestions on what to do for the next sprint, by adjusting the product backlog.

# Sprint Retrospective

After our sprint review, we carried out a sprint retrospective meeting that was timeboxed to a total of 1 hour, where the product owner, scrum master and scrum team members were present. We went over what positives we can take from the sprint and what improvements as a scrum team we need to make.  At the start of our sprint planning meeting we decided on a sprint goal which we said we will strive to achieve by the end of the sprint, that being to complete the exercise list page and exercise page stories to provide a medium for all the students to view the available exercises. 

During the meeting with our client the stories we completed were accepted that resulted in our goal being met which provided a positive impact on our scrum team and motivated us to achieve our next sprint goal. From talking with our supervisor, we now know what we should do differently and improve in the next sprint as we were advised that the way we carry out our testing needs improvement. For instance, our manual testing added no challenge to break the system. Therefore, in the next sprint we will be more creative with our test cases and approach to testing in general. In addition, another aspect we need to improve is our precision of estimating our user stories to ensure we understand our workload according to priorities and time limitation.
